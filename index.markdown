This website provides a place for the LEGO® community to post brick inventories at Pick-a-Brick wall in LEGO® stores. 

This is currently being done in Canada with a Facebook Group:

This application will allow visitors to upload photos and select the actual brick in the photo. Future iterations will usse Machine Learning to identify the brick name and ID.
